# EMINEM Lyrics Analysis
This repository represents the project titled `Eminem Lyrics Analysis`

I am a HUUUUUUGEEEEEE EMIN3M Fan.

Naturally, I wanted to analyze the lyrics written by Eminem. It was just a curiosity and did not know that I would find such an amazing and awesome information by scrapping the lyrics from a website and then running OpenNLP algorithms to derive the various analytical operations on these lyrics.

The technical step by step guide for this project is as follows.

Programming Language: Java
Analytical algorithms: OpenNLP
Eminem Lyrics Dataset: created using Raghav Gupta's scrapping tool.

Emphasis is on performing the following analysis.

### Analysis 1:
`Top 10 most frequent words` used by Eminem in lyrics throughout his career
### Analysis 2:
Are there any `person names` that Eminem has used in his lyrics? If so, how many names are present in his lyrics and what are those names.
### Analysis 3:
`Good/Positive and Bad/Negative words:` What is the distribution of positive and negative words in his lyrics? These counts will give more insights into his lyrics and his career as a whole.
### Analysis 4:
`Sentence Detection:` Generally, lyrics are written without proper sentences. We will try to see if there are proper sentences in Eminem's lyrics. If so, we will try to get count of those sentences.
